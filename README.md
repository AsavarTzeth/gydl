# gydl
gydl (Graphical Youtube-dl) is a GUI wrapper around the already existing youtube-dl program.

Big thank you to the developer(s) of youtube-dl, you can check their project over here:

https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl

# Installation and dependencies
gydl currently only exists as one single script written in python.

To run it, you need to have the following dependencies:

* gtk+3
* python3
* pyobject

# Future

I will keep developing gydl in Python 3, until I can call it stable.

Currently gydl just works, if there are flaws, please submit an issue.

# Usage

The GUI will show an entry to put the URL in and two boxes which will let you choose the quality and format the video/audio should be downloaded in. As of now, gydl will download everything in your home folder. That will be changed later though.
