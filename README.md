# gydl
gydl (Graphical Youtube-dl) is a GUI wrapper around the already existing youtube-dl program.

Big thank you to the developer(s) of youtube-dl, you can check out their project over here:

https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl

# Installation and dependencies
Gydl currently only exists as one single script written in Python 3.

To run it, you need to have the following dependencies:

* gtk+3
* python3
* pyobject

# Future
I will keep developing gydl in Python 3 until I can call it stable.

Currently gydl just works, if there are flaws, please submit an issue.

The code needs much improvement as I've been only concentrating on functionality, it's soon to be done though.

# Usage
The GUI will show an entry to put the URL in and two boxes which will let you choose the quality and format the video/audio should be downloaded in. As of now, gydl will download everything in your home folder. That will be changed later though.
